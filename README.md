# Touch Typing in Russian üá∑üá∫

–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç

Since learning the [Russian language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIKX9RYOX5w) for a couple of years I felt it would also be fun to touch-type in Russian.

I've used various websites ( [1](https://www.ratatype.com/courses/russian/) , [2](https://www.typingstudy.com/en-russian-3/) ) to learn and they're great. And also acquired keyboard stickers as I'm a cheat. But I just need to build up my speed so it's comparible with typing English.

However, I'd like to combine typing with vocabulary building and so I made this little typing game.

( This game was made in about an hour using ChatGPT. )


## Run the game

You need to run a local server to load the vocabularies. I like to use python. So after cloning just $cd to the directory and do this.

```bash
    python3 -m http.server 9000
```

Then you will be able to visit http://localhost:9000/ and play the game.

p.s. you will need to setup the Russian keyboard on your computer of course.

tip: learn the shortcut on your OS to switch keyboard language.
